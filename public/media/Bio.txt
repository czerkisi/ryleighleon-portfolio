I am a graphic designer and a photographer. I have dabbled in letterpress printing, crochet, traditional drawing, and writing. I am very grateful for the opportunities Iâ€™ve had to grow as an artist. From various art presentations, entering and showing my artwork at competitions and exhibitions, and getting internship experience. I am currently continuing my education at the Milwaukee Institute of Art and Design.
